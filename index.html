                <p>Inspired by my passion for physics and puzzles, Light in a Box uses simple ideas around light, shadow
                    and reflection to create challenging puzzles. My original concept game requires the player to place
                    walls and mirrors to mould 2-dimensional light from its source into a given intricate shape. It is
                    far more challenging than it sounds and, ironically, requires out of the box thinking.</p>
                <p>This project was the most challenging I have attempted to date and required me to build a code
                    intensive and deceptively complex lighting and reflection system. Creating this system was a puzzle
                    in and of itself which I thoroughly enjoyed solving. It pushed me to grow my understanding of Unity,
                    in particular its Universal Render Pipeline, and of programming in general.</p>
                <p>Some of the the other barriers I overcame in the creation of this project include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Created all the sprites and artwork for the game in Krita. Including in-game visual effects like
                        lit and unlit glow effects with shader graphs.</li>
                    <li>A functional and sleek UI system.</li>
                    <li>Creation of an effective tutorial which explains the tricky to understand premise of the puzzles
                        without becoming long and boring.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>

                <p>My browser game looks to reimagine the viral New York Times puzzle game, Wordle, and combines it with
                    the traditional board game, Mastermind. By adapting the hint process, I have magnified the problem
                    solving element of the game.</p>
                <p>This project required me to develop a system that can detect when matching letters are placed in the
                    correct space, matching letters placed in the wrong space but additionally how to correctly account
                    for when duplicate letters are placed and how this impacts the hint dynamics. Wordle Mastermind also
                    uses media queries to adapt the size of elements to make the game playable on a variety of devices.

                    ordering, the filtering system returns personalised movie suggestions.</p>
                <p>The most interesting part of this project was making the filtering system that takes any number of
                    user inputs for: which columns to include in the report, movie criteria to be met and how the report
                    should be ordered, to dynamically generate a single SQL query that returns a report that meets all
                    the users conditions.</p>

                <h2>Cloud Seeding Research Project</h2>
                <img class="project-img" src="images/cloud graphic.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Within my final-year Mathematics group project we created and presented a model that used global
                    positioning and seasonal weather data to assess the effectiveness of cloud seeding as a method to
                    combat climate change. </p>
                <p>Cloud seeding is the method of spraying salt aerosols from boats to effect cloud albedo (brightness).
                    Increasing the brightness of clouds has a positive impact on climate change as it increases the
                    amount of light reflected away from the earth and, resultantly, cools it. The program we built took
                    large global weather datasets and ran simulations to see the effect on cloud albedo in different
                    regions at different times of year. Our program returned equally large datasets for us to analyse
                    and draw our conclusions from. This module helped me showcase my communication, teamwork and
                    presenting skills in addition to programming and problem solving.</p>

                <p>I was inspired to make my first original videogame project as a creative birthday present for my
                    sister, Charlotte. Drawing heavy inspiration from Pac-Man, the game features my whole family and our
                    dog Jumble as the protagonist.</p>
                <p>For this game I created pixel art avatars for each member of the family and of our home. But the
                    feature I am most proud of is the chasing/pathing ai system that had a basic understanding of the
                    floorplan of the house to help it calculate the fastest route to target and traverse the environment
                    effectively.</p>

                <p>I created this project as an introduction for myself into XR development. This AR app is a simple

                    environment and the user will be prompted to say the number out loud and find its match in the list
                    of numbers shown.</p>
                <p>For this project I familiarised myself with XR development in unity and included a system that would
                    generate random numbers that would not repeat, with a colourful progress tracker though the first 10
                    numbers.</p>
